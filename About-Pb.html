                My name is Kat Graham. I am a junior studying Computer Science and Graphic Design at The SUNY College <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp at Brockport. 
                I am currently working toward building experience in UX/UI Design and Web Design. Outside <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp of my coursework, I currently balance
                two jobs as a lab assistant in a Mac Lab and as a Panera Employee. I <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp also used to work as an assistant manager in a corporate movie 
                theater called Cinemark. This has given me a  <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp lot of professional experience, better time management, and leadership skills. When it 
                comes to my free, time  <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I enjoy taking photos on my Nikon, drawing, and playing video games.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                My name is Adrianna Marino. 
                I am currently a Junior at the College at Brockport where
                I am  <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp majoring in Computer Information Systems with a minor in 
                Computer Science. My main interests <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp so far are in Unix tools and databases. 
                Outside of my coursework, I am a part of the Women In <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Technology club, 
                Secretary of BASIC, and I am an RA in the McFarlane resident hall. 
                My time in <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp these  clubs and roles has taught me leadership skills, 
                provided great social development, and <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp improved  my ability to multitask several  projects. 
                When it comes to my free time, I enjoy <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp watching football and  playing a few video games.
                I also enjoy a wide variety of music and play the <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp piano as a hobby.

                Outside of my course load, I work three jobs. My time balancing these jobs along with school has <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp taught me time 
                management skills, the ability to work under pressure, and leadership skills. In my rare free <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp time, I like spending 
                as much time outdoors as possible. I enjoy horseback riding, hiking, and camping. I am <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp interested in learning more about your company's career opportunities.
